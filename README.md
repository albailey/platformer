# platformer
The foundation for a NES platformer written in CC65

Current status:  worthless.

The code compiles and does nothing.    Some rudamentary controls and graphics are coming shortly.

There is a Makefile.   
  To build and run,  execute:   make
  To clean up tmp files execute:  make clean
